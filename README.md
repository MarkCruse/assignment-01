## Map675 Assignment-01 Wrangling Geodata via Command Line

Objective:  Create a collaborative map with an assigned classmate.
*   Search for viable project datasets available on [**OpenDataSoft**](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/#/united-states)
* Using techniques learned in MAP675 module-01,
obtain and screen the datasets
    * What format are the shapefile in?
    * Examine the data - is it what I am expecting?
* From command line create a new repository
*   Add collaborators using Github
*   Add Git Projects to the repository to coordinate collaborative effort (use Github)
*   Learn Git Projects


## Data
Each of these datasets were found on [National Park Service - Great Smoky Mountains](https://grsm-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/).

My initial thought is to see if I can create a map showing locations where fish are released into the park's streams. How close are these locations to trails and parking.
